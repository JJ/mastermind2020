          <h2>how to solve them and what they can do for you</h2>

          <aside class='notes'>Oracle puzzles are a kind of games in which you navigate towards a solution through hints that are given by the other player; for instance, you need to find a combination of letters through playing another combination in the same alphabet, and getting in return the number of letters in the correct place, or also the number of correct letters that are misplaced. In this kind of games, minimizing the number of games needed to find the solution implies selecting the combinations so that they extract as much information as possible from the answer, or put in another way, they maximally reduce the amount of remaining combinations.
            Mastermind is such a kind of game, and it's been solved through heuristics in a number of different ways. In this talk we will show the history of this kind of games, what are the keys to its solution, and how it can be extended to other, more general, kind of problems like the game of Hanabi.</aside>

	  <blockquote>At Bletchley Park in World War II, strenuous efforts were made to use messages with known plaintext. For example, when cribs were lacking, Bletchley Park would sometimes ask the Royal Air Force to "seed" a particular area in the North Sea with mines. The Enigma messages that were soon sent out would most likely contain the name of the area or the harbour threatened by the mines</blockquote>
