	<section><h1>Oracle-type puzzles</h1>
          <h2>how to solve them and what they can do for you</h2>

          <aside class='notes'>Oracle puzzles are a kind of games in which you navigate towards a solution through hints that are given by the other player; for instance, you need to find a combination of letters through playing another combination in the same alphabet, and getting in return the number of letters in the correct place, or also the number of correct letters that are misplaced. In this kind of games, minimizing the number of games needed to find the solution implies selecting the combinations so that they extract as much information as possible from the answer, or put in another way, they maximally reduce the amount of remaining combinations.
            Mastermind is such a kind of game, and it's been solved through heuristics in a number of different ways. In this talk we will show the history of this kind of games, what are the keys to its solution, and how it can be extended to other, more general, kind of problems like the game of Hanabi.</aside>

	  <aside class='notes'>A census is an attempt to describe, in a series of questions, a whole population, but, in principle, if you know the answer to all the questions, can you identify a person? A census is an oracle or a black box that can reveal things about the population, and, if used wisely (for instance during elections) about the person itself.</aside>

	  <blockquote>At Bletchley Park in World War II, strenuous efforts were made to use messages with known plaintext. For example, when cribs were lacking, Bletchley Park would sometimes ask the Royal Air Force to "seed" a particular area in the North Sea with mines. The Enigma messages that were soon sent out would most likely contain the name of the area or the harbour threatened by the mines</blockquote>

	  <h1>Mordecai Morowitz created Mastermind in 1971</h1>
	  <h2 class='fragment'>Yep, same initials</h2>
	  <aside class='notes'>He's been said to be "postmaster and cryptographer" or "telecommunications expert". As a matter of fact, the game is not so different from bulls and cows; only difference is the physical appearance and the fact that codes need not be isograms. He managed to convince a company in Leicester, Invicta Plastics, to commercialize it, after being not so successful in Israel. It would be nice to know the story. Apparently, according to <a href='https://www.beautifulbritain.co.uk/htm/onthisday/February/a208.htm'>this site</a> it happened on 7th February of 1971 at the Nuremberg Toy Fair 49 years, 1 month and 1 day ago... Also, question. There's a computer scientist and a hairdresser in this picture. Who is who? Additionally, this is the  headline of <a href='https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/884k54/permalink-mastermind-board-game-50th-anniversary-origins-fallout-cybersecurity'>this article in Vice</a>, that appeared yesterda, and that claims that Mastermind was 50 years yesterday (probably not true).</aside>
