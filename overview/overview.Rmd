Google Scholar returns, in all, 57 articles that mention the words Mastermind and game in their title. That meager number does not really reflect the interest from all kind of fields this game has arisen. Since 2016, 8 papers have used the words in the title, every one of them with a different approach to solving the game or using it for other purposes, from teaching to psychological evaluation.
